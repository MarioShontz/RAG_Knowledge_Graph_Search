    "# Knowledge-Graph-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation for FSU Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The problem\n",
    "The search functionality on fsu.edu sites is fragmented and cumbersome. Its functionality reflects none of the recent advancements in natural language processing - specifically, Large Language Models and the ability to intelligently and naturally respond to queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:c99493ef-b153-4d79-a795-b4dc7d6f59e4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to do two main modifications:\n",
    "1. combine these searches into one, providing only an option to limit to the current site.\n",
    "2. Wield the power of Large Language Models to allow for conversational or question/answer capability using direct information from FSU's databases and websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is with these requirements that we present a possible solution:\n",
    "**Combining the power of knowledge graphs, a powerful way to represent relational data, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique for informing Language Models with real data, we can make a powerful pairing that allows for users to get information about FSU faculty, staff, departments, buildings, events, classes, and more.**\n",
    "\n",
    "let's explore how we do this."

These events must address, from multiple, divergent, and opposing perspectives, an extensive range of public policy issues widely discussed and debated in society at large.

At least two events must occur during the fall semester and at least two events must occur during the spring semester.\\n\\n2.\\u2003Such debates and group forums must include speakers who represent widely held views on opposing sides of the most widely discussed public policy issues of the day and who hold a wide diversity of perspectives from within and outside of the state university community.\\n\\n3.\\u2003If the office is unable to readily find an advocate from within the state university community who is well-versed in a perspective, the office shall invite a speaker who is able to represent such perspective.

The principles of freedom of speech and freedom of expression in the United States and Florida Constitutions, in addition to being legal rights, are an integral part of our three-part university mission to deliver a high quality academic experience for our students, engage in meaningful and productive research, and provide valuable public service for the benefit of our local communities and the state. The purpose of this Statement is to affirm our dedication to these principles and to seek our campus communities�'), Document(page_content=\" and the state. The purpose of this Statement is to affirm our dedication to these principles and to seek our campus communities’ commitment to maintaining our campuses as places where the open exchange of knowledge and ideas furthers our mission.\\n\\nA fundamental purpose of an institution of higher education is to provide a learning environment where divergent ideas, opinions and philosophies, new and old, can be rigorously debated and critically evaluated. Through this process, often referred to as the marketplace of ideas, individuals are free to express any ideas and opinions they wish, even if others may disagree with them or find those ideas and opinions to be offensive or otherwise antithetical to their own world view. The very process of debating divergent ideas and challenging others’ opinions develops the intellectual skills necessary to respectfully argue through civil discourse. Development of such skills leads to personal and scholarly growth and is an essential component of the academic and research missions of each of our institutions.\\n\\nIt is equally important not to stifle the dissemination of any ideas, even if other members of our community may find those ideas abhorrent. Individuals wishing to express ideas with which others may disagree must be free to do so, without fear of being bullied, threatened or silenced. This does not mean that such ideas should go unchallenged, as that is part of the learning process. And though we believe all members of our campus communities have a role to play in promoting civility and mutual respect in that type of discourse, we must not let concerns over civility or respect be used as a reason to silence expression. We should empower and enable one another to speak and listen, rather than interfere with or silence the open expression of ideas.\\n\\nEach member of our campus communities must also recognize that institutions may restrict expression that is unlawful, such as true threats or defamation. Because universities and colleges are first and foremost places where people go to engage in scholarly endeavors, it is necessary to the efficient and effective operations of each institution for there to be reasonable limitations on the time, place, and manner in which these rights are exercised. Each institution has adopted regulations that align with Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act, section 1004.097, Florida Statutes, and with the United States and Florida Constitutions and the legal opinions interpreting those provisions. These limitations are narrowly drawn and content-neutral and serve to ensure that all members of our campus communities have an equal ability to express their ideas and opinions, while preserving campus order and security.\\n links in page: ['https://www.fsu\"), Document(page_content=\" their ideas and opinions, while preserving campus order and security.\\n links in page: ['https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/calendar.html', 'https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/archive.html', 'https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/contact.html']]\\nWebpage: https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/archive.html[ content: # [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/archive.html)\\n\\nAuthor: Florida State University\\nContent:\\n![](https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/images/library-3x2-1140.jpg) ![](https://www.fsu.edu/public-policy-events/images/library-3x1-2280.jpg)\\n\\n## The Florida State University Office of Public Policy Events\\n\\nFall 2023\\n\\n## Two Debates on the Impacts of Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nJoin the Florida State University Office of Public Policy Events for two debates on the impacts of artificial intelligence in society.
